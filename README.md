<h1>Installation & Deployment 📦</h1>

Clone the repository and modify the content of index.html according to your requirement.

Add or remove images from varadbhogayata.github.io/assets/img/ directory as per your requirement.

I highly recommend to use Github Pages to deploy the website the EASIEST WAY.

To deploy your website, first you need to create github repository with name <your-github-username>.github.io. Please don't give any other name.

Push the generated code to the master branch of this repository.

NOTE: Make sure to set analyticsId from your Google Analytics account inside the Google Analytics script tag, if you want to use your own Google Analytics account.
